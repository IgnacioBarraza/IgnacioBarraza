Hello! I'm Ignacio but you can call me Nacho, I'm currently studying informatic engineering at Tarapacá University in Iquique, Chile.
I'm interested in web development, so I'm doing some courses about Full Stack development because I want to work in this area, so I'm trying to improve myself in this area.
Also I'm studying a little bit of data science because is a subject of my career, I thing that is really interesting but I prefer web development.
I'm also improving my english level, so that is not an obstacle for me to work in english speaking countries.
