# About Me
Hey! if you're reading this it's probably 'cause you are too bored or you like my profile and looking what I have done as a informatic engineer student (not as much as other, but it's an honest job (I'm going to thing that you get the meme 🧐))

Well, let me introduce myself.  
I'm Ignacio, but you can call me Nacho 😉, a 21 y.o. informatic engineer student and a (in progress) software developer.  
I'm studying at University of Tarapacá (I thing 🤔).  
From the north part of Chile 🇨🇱, especific I'm from a city called Iquique 🐉  
So thats the important things about me, if you want to know more about me you can send me a email here ignacio.barraza.rioja@gmail.com or send me a dm on my instagram [Nacho's ig](https://www.instagram.com/_nacho0._/) or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-barraza-rioja/)

(idk why is this gif here, but I like it :D)

# Hobbies
I like to play video games in my free time, game like genshin, csgo, overwatch, starcraft, the legend of zelda (any game) and pokemon (any game).  
I play the acoustic guitar (I'm a little rusty on that, so I thing I should play more often(?)).  
Recently I discovered the interesting(?) world of mounting an own server using a raspberry pi, so now I'm ~~destroying~~ setting up my own server and trying different things on it XD.  
Also I'm interest by the 3D world, so I'm learning how to create my own 3D design, or create anime things (like weapons or things like that) to become an anime prop maker and print it in a 3D printer (wish me luck, it's a little bit difficult this world, but it's fun)  
And yea I watch anime, read mangas and ligth novels

# Job Experience
## Lazarillo
I'm working at Lazarillo as a full stack developer since February of 2023 to date, making the world more accessible for everyone :D

## Freelancer
Also I make my own projects, like my [portfolio](https://devnacho.me/) (🚧 working on that) and one or another project for people who contact me to make real their projects in the web 

# Spoken language
I speak Spanish 'cause is my native language 🤔, but also I speak English very well, and I'm learning japanese.
